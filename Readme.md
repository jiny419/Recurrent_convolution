# Recurrent convolution networks
## Key features 
- Both feed-forward and recurrent connections have local connectivity and shared weights among different locations. 
- Architecture is very similar to the recurrent multi layer perceptron
- The main difference is that the full connections in RMLP are replaced by shared local connections, just as the difference between MLP and CNN.
